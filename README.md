# Shubham's-Portfolio

# [Project 1: IBM Data Science Capstone Project](https://github.com/shubhamborade1411/Data-Science-Capstone-project-IBM-Coursera)
- The data is acquired by using csv and webscraping the websites.
- The project is about the landing of Falcon 9. Will it be successful or not?
- Performed EDA using SQL and visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn in Jupyter Notebook.
- Algorithms Used: Decision Tree, KNN, Logistic Regression.

# [Project 2: Customer_Segmentation_Model](https://github.com/shubhamborade1411/Customer-Segmentation)
- The data is acquired from kaggle.
- Algorithms Used: KMeans, PCA.
- Model accuracy increased by using PCA.

# [Project 3: Cricket Analytics](https://github.com/shubhamborade1411/Cricket-Analytics)
- It's a project based on Cricket data of recently concluded T20 world cup and I have done a project to get the best playing XI out of all Players.
- I webscraped 1 file from internet and acquired other data in form of json.
- I transformed those json files and then loaded them into PowerBi to make Interactive dashboards.
- Tools Used: PowerBI, Pandas

# [Project 4: Stock Price Prediction](https://github.com/shubhamborade1411/stock-prediction)
-  I acquired data from Tiingo api which provide us real time data through api service. As it is real time data, so there are almost no missing values and any other data mismatch. 
-  The model I used to make prediction is stacked LSTM which stands for Long Short term memory.
-  Tools and Packages Used: Sklearn, Pandas, Tensorflow

# [Project 5: Credit Card Defaulters](https://github.com/shubhamborade1411/Credit_card_defaulters/blob/main/README.md)
- The data is taken from one of the competition of the Kaggle.
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis on dataset and modified data to add some feature which could add value in final prediction.
- Algorithms Used: DecisionTree, Logistic Regression
- Tools and Packages used : Pandas, Sklearn

# [Project 6: Dashboard On Global Superstore Data](https://github.com/shubhamborade1411/Global-Superstore-Dashboard)
- The data is acquired from internet in form of csv.
- Performed transformation on data in PowerBI.
- Made this interactive dashboard in PowerBI.
## Dashboard is shown here ![](https://github.com/shubhamborade1411/Global-Superstore-Dashboard/blob/main/Screenshot%20(847).png)
