# Shubham's-Portfolio

# [Project 1: IBM Data Science Capstone Project](https://github.com/shubhamborade1411/Data-Science-Capstone-project-IBM-Coursera)
- The data is acquired by using csv and webscraping the websites.
- The project is about the landing of Falcon 9. Will it be successful or not?
- Performed EDA using SQL and visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn in Jupyter Notebook.
- Algorithms Used: Decision Tree, KNN, Logistic Regression.

# [Project 2: IPL Team Winning Probability Predictor Model](https://github.com/shubhamborade1411/IPL-Winner-Predictor)
- The data is acquired from Kaggle.
- The project is for the prediction of probability of a team based on different parameters like overs remaining, wickets remaining and venue.
- The data was in multiple csv's and from those csv's.
- Performed data cleaning and data manipulation on different dataframes and then lastly merged the required features to build the model.
- Then finally deployed model using Streamlit.

# [Project 3 : Telecom Customer Churn Prediction](https://github.com/shubhamborade1411/Telco-churn-prediction)
- Acquired dataset from kaggle.
- The main business solution the project solves is predicting the possibility of customer churning in near future.
- Performed exploratory data analysis on data to find the feature importance.
- Applied decision tree and Random Forest but Random forest was giving better accuracy so finally used it to generate pkl file.
- Deployed Web App th predict will customer churn or not on the basis of different parameters.

# [Project 4: Customer_Segmentation_Model](https://github.com/shubhamborade1411/Customer-Segmentation)
- The data is acquired from kaggle.
- Algorithms Used: KMeans, PCA.
- Model accuracy increased by using PCA.

# [Project 5: Cricket Analytics](https://github.com/shubhamborade1411/Cricket-Analytics)
- It's a project based on Cricket data of recently concluded T20 world cup and I have done a project to get the best playing XI out of all Players.
- I webscraped 1 file from internet and acquired other data in form of json.
- I transformed those json files and then loaded them into PowerBi to make Interactive dashboards.
- Tools Used: PowerBI, Pandas
## One of the dashboard ![](https://github.com/shubhamborade1411/Cricket-Analytics/blob/main/Screenshot%20(844).png)

# [Project 6: Stock Price Prediction](https://github.com/shubhamborade1411/stock-prediction)
-  I acquired data from Tiingo api which provide us real time data through api service. As it is real time data, so there are almost no missing values and any other data mismatch. 
-  The model I used to make prediction is stacked LSTM which stands for Long Short term memory.
-  Tools and Packages Used: Sklearn, Pandas, Tensorflow

# [Project 7: Credit Card Defaulters](https://github.com/shubhamborade1411/Credit_card_defaulters/blob/main/README.md)
- The data is taken from one of the competition of the Kaggle.
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis on dataset and modified data to add some feature which could add value in final prediction.
- Algorithms Used: DecisionTree, Logistic Regression
- Tools and Packages used : Pandas, Sklearn

# [Project 8: Dashboard On Global Superstore Data](https://github.com/shubhamborade1411/Global-Superstore-Dashboard)
- The data is acquired from internet in form of csv.
- Performed transformation on data in PowerBI.
- Made this interactive dashboard in PowerBI.
## Dashboard is shown here ![](https://github.com/shubhamborade1411/Global-Superstore-Dashboard/blob/main/Screenshot%20(847).png)
